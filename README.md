##General Information
A finance company always has a question in their mind whether to lend a loan to a consumer or not. They do a lot of work 
at the backend before lending the money so that they dont end up in a loss and the loan is repayed. Hence this project 
helps in analyzing such factors that can be beneficial for the company in picking the right person for the loan.
The loan.csv dataset was used in the project and initially the data was cleaned and then various kinds of analysis has been
carried out.

##Conclusions
Most of the charged off loans were not verified
Loans with interest rates from 13%-17% has more defaulters
Defaulters are more from an employment experience of 10 or more years. Is it the over trust or the fake experience being submitted?
Defaulters are more if the loan issued month is December
Applicants with higher salary mostly applied loans for "home_improvment", "house", "renewable_energy" and "small_businessesâ€œ and fell into defaulters
Debt_Consolidation has been the highest case where the loan is charged off
